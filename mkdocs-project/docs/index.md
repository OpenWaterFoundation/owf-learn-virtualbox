# Open Water Foundation / Learn VirtualBox #

This documentation provides resources to learn how to use the VirtualBox software,
which allows virtual machines (VMs) for "guest" operating systems to be run on the "host" operating system.
This is particularly useful when a full Linux operating system needs to be run on a Windows desktop computer,
for example for software development and testing.
If a full VM is not needed, consider using [Cygwin](http://learn.openwaterfoundation.org/owf-learn-cygwin/),
Git Bash, MinGW, or Linux Subsystem on Windows 10
([see information about Linux shells](http://learn.openwaterfoundation.org/owf-learn-linux-shell/install/install/)).

This documentation has been written based on experience using VirtualBox at the Open Water Foundation.

## About the Open Water Foundation ##

The [Open Water Foundation](http://openwaterfoundation.org) is a nonprofit social enterprise that focuses
on developing and supporting open source software for water resources, so that organizations can make better decisions about water.
OWF also works to advance open data tools and implementation.
OWF has created this documentation to educate its staff, collaborators, and clients that use VirtualBox.

## How to Use this Documentation ##

The documentation is organized in order of information and tasks necessary to install, configure, and use VirtualBox.
