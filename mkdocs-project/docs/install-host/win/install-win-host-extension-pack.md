# Virtural Box / Windows 10 Host / Install Extension Pack

The Windows 10 host extension pack contains additional software to optimize integration
with host hardware such as USB.

**Note that the extension pack is free for evaluation and personal use but is not free for commercial use.**
The extension pack is generally not needed unless devices such as USB are used with the VM.
In many cases such devices can be used on the host operating system, for example using shared folders.

The following are installation instructions.

* [Manually Install Extension Pack](#manually-install-extension-pack)
* [Update Existing Extension Pack Installation](#update-existing-extension-pack-installation) - typically
will be prompted for this case when main VirtualBox software is installed

------------------

## Manually Install Extension Pack ##

To install the extension pack manually, first download the extension pack from the
[Download VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) website.
The extension pack is clearly indicated.
The download file will have a name similar to `Oracle_VM_VirtualBox_Extension_Pack-6.0.4.vbox-extpack`.

The installer needs to be run with administrator privileges but it may not be obvious whether this
is the case because the installer is run from within the ***VirtualBox Manager***
(with no virtual machines listed).
On Windows 10, double-clicking on the file to run the installer.

If the extension pack is already installed, a prompt will ask whether to reinstall.

A prompt may be shown to accept one or more licenses.  Press ***I Agree***.

If an error is shown, it may be that the installer was not run as an administrator.
If right-clicking on the installer shows the ***Run as Administrator*** menu, use it.
Otherwise, run the Windows command prompt as administrator, change to the location of the installer,
and run the installer on the command line.
This will run the ***VirtualBox Manager*** to install the extension pack.

The following will be shown if the extension pack installs successfully:
