# VirtualBox / Windows 10 Host / Export Linux Debian Jessie VM Appliance #

Once a VM has been created, it can be exported as an "appliance", which is a self-contained
VM file that can be imported into VirtualBox running on another computer.
This is useful when a standard environment needs to be used on multiple computers,
for example:

* software development VM - will install software necessary for development,
such as compilers and integrated development environments
* software build/testing VM - may build software and test in multiple configurations
* operational system VM - production system for operations

To export a Linux Debian Jessie appliance, first make sure that the VM is stopped.
Then select the ***VirtualBox Manager / Tools***.

**THE IMAGES IN THIS PAGE NEED TO BE UPDATED.**

Select the ***Export*** tool.  Select the VM to export, as shown in the following image.
When creating an appliance the virtual name should be indicative,
for example `vb-orgname-debian-jessie-64-20d-bare`,
which indicates VirtualBox appliance for a specific organization, Debian Jessie 64 bit, 20 GB dynamic hard drive,
and "bare" indicates bare system with minimal software.

The default "guided mode" can be used by pressing ***Next***, which uses typical defaults.

The default selections will for the most part be OK.
The name can be long because the VM name will be assigned when importing.  For example, use something like:

```
vb-orgname-debian-jessie-64-20d-bare-2019-01-01.ova
```

The file extension will be consistent with the format.
Using the default `ova` extension results in a single file for the appliance, which simplifies moving the appliance.

Press ***Next*** to continue.  The following will be shown to configure system settings.
The initial defaults will be similar to the following, where the name matches the VM name that is being exported.

Similar to changing the filename, the name of the VM can be changed a general version:

```
vb-orgname-debian-jessie-64-20d-bare
```

This general name can be changed when the appliance is imported later.
Information for the product can also be specified, as shown in the following example.
