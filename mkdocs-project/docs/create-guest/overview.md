# VirtualBox / Create Guest VM / Overview #

This documentation focuses on creating Linux guest VM to run on a Windows host computer.
The instructions are for specific operating system versions,
although the steps should be similar for different versions.

There are two ways to add a new virtual machine (VM) to VirtualBox:

1.  Create a guest VM from scratch, for example:
    *   [Create a Linux Debian Jessie Guest VM](linux-debian-jessie/create-guest-debian-jessie.md)
2.  Import an appliance, for example:
    *   See the [Import Appliance](../import-appliance/overview.md) documentation.
