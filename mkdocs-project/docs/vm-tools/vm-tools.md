# VirtualBox / VM Tools #

***VirtualBox Manager*** VM tools can be used to manipulate VMs.
VirtualBox tools are somewhat confusing to explain because there are several sets of tools shown
depending on whether one of the following is accessed:

*   ***Tools*** button at the top of the ***VirtualBox Manager***.
*   ***Machine / Tools*** menu (requires that a machine is selected).
*   Tools shown in upper right when a machine is selected.

The following tools are available:

*   [Clone VM](clone-vm/clone-vm.md)
*   additional documentation will be added later for other tools
